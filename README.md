# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
The Project aims to analyse sentiments of around 1.6 million tweets data. Dataset "Sentiment 140 dataset" is taken from Kaggle for the sentiment analysis. In this I have first performed exploratory data analysis on dataset then use Natural Language Toolkit(NLTK) for data preprocessing and Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).
